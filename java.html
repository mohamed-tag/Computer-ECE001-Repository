<p style="color:white; font-size:35">Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that is designed to contain the fewest possible implementation dependencies. It is intended to allow application developers to write once and run anywhere (WORA), which means that translated Java code can be run on all platforms that support Java without the need for re-translation. Java applications are usually grouped into a byte code that can be run on any virtual Java device (JVM) regardless of computer infrastructure. The architecture is similar to Java C and C ++, but it has fewer lower level utilities than either. As of 2019, Java has been one of the most popular programming languages ​​used according to GitHub, specially for web server client applications, with 9 million developers.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which Oracle has since acquired) and was released in 1995 as a core component of the Sun Microsystems Java platform. Original and reference Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were released by Sun under royalty licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the Java Community Process specification, Sun has revised most of its Java technologies under a public GNU license. Meanwhile, others have developed alternative applications for these Sun technologies, such as GNU compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries) and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for small applications).</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">The latest releases are Java 14, released in March 2020, and Java 11, long-term support release (LTS) currently supported, released on September 25, 2018; Oracle released the old and final Java 8 LTS release the latest free public update in January 2019 for commercial use, while it would still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use until at least December 2020. Oracle (and others) strongly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java due to serious risks due to unresolved security issues. Since Java 9, 10, 12, and 13 are no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to move immediately to the latest version (currently Java 14) or an LTS release.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35"><b><u>History</u></b></p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">James Gosling, Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton started the Java Language Project in June 1991. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but was very advanced to the digital cable TV industry at the time. The language was initially called the oak after the oak tree that stands outside the Gosling office. The project was later named Green and was finally renamed Java, Java Java, Coffee from Indonesia. Gosling designed Java using C / C ++ syntax that familiar system and application programmers would find.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">Sun Microsystems released its first public application called Java 1.0 in 1996. It promised a one-time write-and-play-anywhere (WORA) function, providing no-cost run times on popular platforms. Somewhat safe and configurable security, it allowed network and file access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets into web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 translator has been rewritten in Java by Arthur van Hoff to fully comply with the Java 1.0 language specification. With the advent of Java 2 (initially released as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 - 1999), new releases had multiple configurations created for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for corporate applications typically running in server environments, while J2ME featured improved APIs for mobile applications. The desktop version has been renamed to J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed the new J2 releases as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO / IEC JTC 1 standard and then Ecma International to formalize Java, but soon withdrew from the process. Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java applications available without charge, despite the status of its software. Sun has made a profit from Java by selling specialized product licenses like the Java Enterprise System.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">On November 13, 2006, Sun released a large portion of its Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as a free and open source (FOSS) program, under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). On May 8, 2007, Sun ended the process, making all of its underlying JVM code available under the free / open source distribution terms, regardless of a small portion of the code that Sun does not own copyright.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">Sun Rich Rich's vice president said Sun's ideal role in Java was promising. After Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems in 2009-2010, Oracle has described itself as a supervisor of Java technology with a firm commitment to enhancing the sharing and transparency community. This didn't prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google soon after to use Java inside the Android SDK (see Android section).</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">In January 2016, Oracle announced that JDK 9 based Java runtime environments would stop the browser plug-in.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">Java runs on everything from laptop computers to data centers and game consoles to supercomputers.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35"><b><u>Principles</u></b></p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:</p>
<ol>
    <li style="color:white; font-size:35">It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.</li>
	<li style="color:white; font-size:35">It must be robust and secure.</li>
	<li style="color:white; font-size:35">It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
	<li style="color:white; font-size:35">It must execute with high performance.</li>
	<li style="color:white; font-size:35">It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</li>
