<p style="color:white; font-size:35">C is a powerful general-purpose programming language.
 It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.
 C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972.
 It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system.
 The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.
Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language. 
Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (There are few programs that may compile in C, but not in C++)</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">1-Structure of a C program</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">After the above discussion, we can formally assess the structure of a C program. By structure, it is meant that any program can be written in this structure only. Writing a C program in any other structure will hence lead to a Compilation Error. 
The structure of a C program is as follows:</p>

<p style="color:white; font-size:35">3-How to excecute the above program</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">Inorder to execute the above program, we need to have a compiler to compile and run our programs. There are certain online compilers like <a href="https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org">https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org</a> <a href="http://ideone.com">http://ideone.com</a> or <a href="http://codepad.org">http://codepad.org</a> that can be used to start C without installing a compiler.</p>
<P style="color:white; font-size:35">Windows: There are many compilers available freely for compilation of C programs like Code Blocks  and Dev-CPP. We strongly recommend Code Blocks.</P>
<P style="color:white; font-size:35">Linux: For Linux, gcc comes bundled with the linux,  Code Blocks can also be used with Linux.</P></div>
