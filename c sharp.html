<p style="color:white; font-size:35">C# (pronounced see sharp, like the musical note C♯, but written with the number sign) is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative and later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Mono is the name of the free and open-source project to develop a compiler and runtime for the language. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI).

C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is currently led by Mads Torgersen. The most recent version is 8.0, which was released in 2019 alongside Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35"><b><u>Design goals?</u></b></p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">The Ecma standard lists these design goals for C#:</p>
<p>
<ul>
       <li style="color:white; font-size:35">The language is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">The language, and implementations thereof, should provide support for software engineering principles such as strong type checking, array bounds checking, detection of attempts to use uninitialized variables, and automatic garbage collection. Software robustness, durability, and programmer productivity are important.</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">The language is intended for use in developing software components suitable for deployment in distributed environments.</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">Portability is very important for source code and programmers, especially those already familiar with C and C++.</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">Support for internationalization is very important.</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">C# is intended to be suitable for writing applications for both hosted and embedded systems, ranging from the very large that use sophisticated operating systems, down to the very small having dedicated functions.</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">Although C# applications are intended to be economical with regard to memory and processing power requirements, the language was not intended to compete directly on performance and size with C or assembly language.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35"><b><u>History</u></b></p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">During the development of the .NET Framework, class libraries were originally written using a managed code compiler system called "Simple Managed C" (SMC). In January 1999, Anders Hegelsberg formed a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which means "object-oriented language." Microsoft has considered retaining the name "Cool" as the final name for the language, but has chosen not to do so for trademark reasons. While the .NET project was publicly announced at the July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the C # language was renamed, and the ASP.NET class and libraries runtime were moved to C #.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">Hejlsberg is the lead C # designer and lead architect at Microsoft, previously co-designing Turbo Pascal, Embarcadero Delphi (formerly known as CodeGear Delphi, Inprise Delphi and Borland Delphi) and Visual J. In interviews and technical papers, he mentioned defects in most languages Key programming (such as C, Java, Delphi, and Smalltalk) propelled the basics of the common language runtime (CLR), which in turn led to the design of the C # language itself.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">James Gosling, who invented the Java programming language in 1994, and Bill Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, the Java creator, called the C # "imitation" Java. Gosling also said that "[C #] is a type of Java with reliability, productivity, and deleted security." Klaus Kreft and Angelica Langer (authors of C Streams) mentioned in a blog post that "Java and C # are almost identical programming languages. Boring repetition lacks innovation" "Hardly anyone will claim that Java or C # are revolutionary programming languages ​​that have changed the way We write programs with it, “and C # borrowed a lot of Java - and vice versa. Now that C # supports boxing and unpacking, we'll have a very similar feature in Java.” In July 2000, Hejlsberg said C # was not a “version of Java” And 'closer to C' in its design.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">Since the release of C # 2.0 in November 2005, the C # and Java languages ​​have evolved on increasingly differentiated tracks, and have become completely different languages. One of the first major departures came with the addition of drugs to both languages, with significantly different applications. C # reification is used to provide "first class" general objects that can be used like any other class, while executing code generation at class load time. Furthermore, C # added several key features to accommodate programming in a functional style, culminating in LINQ extensions released with C # 3.0 and its support framework for lambda expressions, extension methods, and anonymous types. These features enable C # programmers to use functional programming techniques, such as closings, when they are useful for their application. LINQ extensions and functional imports help developers reduce the amount of code involved in common tasks such as querying a database, analyzing an xml file, or searching by data structure, and shifting focus to actual program logic to help improve reading and maintainability.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">C # contained a talisman called Andy (named after Anders Hejlsberg). Retired on January 29, 2004.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">C # was originally submitted to the ISO JTC 1 / SC 22 Subcommittee for review under ISO / IEC 23270: 2003, withdrawn and then approved under ISO / IEC 23270: 2006.</p></div>
