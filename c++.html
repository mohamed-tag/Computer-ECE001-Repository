<p style="color:white; font-size:35"><b><u>What is C++?</b></u></p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">C ++ (/ ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs /) is a general purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded greatly over time, and modern C ++ has general and functional features in addition to low-level memory processing facilities. It is almost always implemented as a localized language, and many vendors offer C ++ translators, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so they are available on many platforms.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">C ++ is partially designed towards system programming, embedded software, resource-constrained systems, and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility for use in design lighting. C ++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, where the main strengths are software infrastructure and limited resource applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (such as e-commerce, web search, or SQL servers) and application performance Embarrassment (such as phone keys or space probes).</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">C ++ has been standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the adoption of the latest standard version and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO / IEC 14882: 2017 (informally known as C ++ 17). The C ++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO / IEC 14882: 1998, which was subsequently modified to C ++ 03, C ++ 11 and C ++ 14. It replaces the current C ++ 17 standard. Replace these new features and an extended standard library. Before standardization in 1998, C ++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup in Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of C language; He wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C which also provided high-level features for organizing the program. C ++ 20 is the next planned standard, in line with the current trend of a new release every three years.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35"><b><u>History</b></u></p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">in 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to C++. The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features. C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this new language, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">Initially, Stroustrup's "C with Classes" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining and default arguments.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">In 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named "C++" (++ being the increment operator in C) after going through several other names. New features were added, including virtual functions, function name and operator overloading, references, constants, type-safe free-store memory allocation (new/delete), improved type checking, and BCPL style single-line comments with two forward slashes (//). Furthermore, Stroustrup developed a new, standalone compiler for C++, Cfront.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">In 1985, the first edition of The C++ Programming Language was released, which became the definitive reference for the language, as there was not yet an official standard.[18] The first commercial implementation of C++ was released in October of the same year.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">In 1989, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming Language in 1991. New features in 2.0 included multiple inheritance, abstract classes, static member functions, const member functions, and protected members. In 1990, The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was published. This work became the basis for the future standard. Later feature additions included templates, exceptions, namespaces, new casts, and a Boolean type.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">After C++98, C++ evolved relatively slowly until, in 2011, the C++11 standard was released, adding numerous new features, enlarging the standard library further, and providing more facilities to C++ programmers. After a minor C++14 update released in December 2014, various new additions were introduced in C++17, and further changes planned for 2020.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">As of 2019, C++ is now the fourth most popular programming language, behind Java, C, and Python.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">On January 3, 2018, Stroustrup was announced as the 2018 winner of the Charles Stark Draper Prize for Engineering, "for conceptualizing and developing the C++ programming language".</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35"><b><u>Etymology</b></u></p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">According to Stroustrup, "the name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C". This name is credited to Rick Mascitti (mid-1983) and was first used in December 1983. When Mascitti was questioned informally in 1992 about the naming, he indicated that it was given in a tongue-in-cheek spirit. The name comes from C's ++ operator (which increments the value of a variable) and a common naming convention of using "+" to indicate an enhanced computer program.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">During C++'s development period, the language had been referred to as "new C" and "C with Classes" before acquiring its final name.</p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35"><u><b>Philosophy</b></u></p>
<p style="color:white; font-size:35">Throughout C++'s life, its development and evolution has been guided by a set of principles:</p>
<ul>
       <li style="color:white; font-size:35">It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be immediately useful in real world programs.</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">Every feature should be implementable (with a reasonably obvious way to do so).</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">Programmers should be free to pick their own programming style, and that style should be fully supported by C++.</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible misuse of C++.</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">It should provide facilities for organising programs into separate, well-defined parts, and provide facilities for combining separately developed parts.</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">No implicit violations of the type system (but allow explicit violations; that is, those explicitly requested by the programmer).</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">User-created types need to have the same support and performance as built-in types.</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">Unused features should not negatively impact created executables (e.g. in lower performance).</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">There should be no language beneath C++ (except assembly language).</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">C++ should work alongside other existing programming languages, rather than fostering its own separate and incompatible programming environment.</li>
	   <li style="color:white; font-size:35">If the programmer's intent is unknown, allow the programmer to specify it by providing manual control.</li>
</ul>
